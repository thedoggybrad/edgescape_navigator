# Edgescape Navigator
Edgescape Navigator is a web browser which is literally just a web browser. It has no bloatware, no mess and no unnecessary features. Just buttons for forward, backward, reload, homepage and about and also the addressbar. It is powered by EdgeWebView2 runtime.
<br><br>
The latest version 2.0 is built on Visual Studio 2022 (Visual Basic) under .NET Framework 4.8.<br>
While, the 1.x release series is built on Visual Studio 2015 (Visual Basic) under .NET Framework 4.5.2.<br><br>

## Upcoming Easier Installation Method (Not yet working)
The software is now available on Winget. Simply run the command:
````
winget install -e --id TheDoggyBradSoftwareLabs.EdgescapeNavigator
````
And follow the on-screen instructions.



## Minimum System Requirements
•Windows 7 and above with 64-bit processor (Windows 10 and above is recommended)
<br>
•1GB RAM (2GB will be much better)
<br>
•1GHZ single core processor
<br>
•**Microsoft EdgeWebView2 installed** (YOU MUST HAVE THIS ON YOUR SYSTEM)

## In case you do not have EdgeWebView2 installed
You may download it [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/?form=MA13LH) and install it on your system.<br><br>
But if you have a Windows 11 system, chances are high that you have EdgeWebView2 already pre-installed on your system. But if you have Windows 10 and lower check it first if you have one. But the safe rule is that if you have the Chromium Edge installed, the higher the chance that EdgeWebView2 is already installed on your system.

## Updates
This project is not updated regularly as it relies on the updates of EdgeWebView2 on your system. Just ensure that EdgeWebView2 is update then you're fine. In case I release new releases, you can find it just in this GitHub repository.
