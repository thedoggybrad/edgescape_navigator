# Edgescape Navigator
Edgescape Navigator is a web browser which is literally just a web browser. It has no bloatware, no mess and no unnecessary features. Just buttons for forward, backward, reload, homepage and about and also the addressbar.
<br><br>
The latest version 2.0 is built on Visual Studio 2022 (Visual Basic) under .NET Framework 4.8.<br>
While, the 1.x release series is built on Visual Studio 2015 (Visual Basic) under .NET Framework 4.5.2.

Edgescape Navigator is a web browser created using Visual Basic 2015, using the EdgeWebView2 runtime. It is creted by TheDoggyBrad. If you want to update this web browser, just update your EdgeWebView2 runtime.

## Minimum System Requirements
•Windows 7 and above with 64-bit processor
<br>
•1GB RAM (2GB will be much better)
<br>
•1GHZ single core processor
<br>
•Microsoft EdgeWebView2 installed

## Updates
This project is not updated regularly as it relies on the updated of EdgeWebView2 on your system. Just ensure that EdgeWebView2 is update then you're find. In case I release new releases, you can find it just in this GitHub repository.
