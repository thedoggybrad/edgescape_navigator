# Edgescape Navigator
Edgescape Navigator is a web browser created using Visual Basic 2015, using the EdgeWebView2 runtime. It is creted by TheDoggyBrad. If you want to update this web browser, just update your EdgeWebView2 runtime.

## Microsoft Edge?, Netscape Navigator?
Yes, weird naming but this browser is created to escape Microsoft Edge but still using it's engine and some UI elements. For the Navigator part, it is inspired by my other project "Website Navigator" based on CefSharp using Visual Basic.
